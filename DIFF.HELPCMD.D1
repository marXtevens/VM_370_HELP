Notes:-                                                                         
                                                                                
1. This is a straight port of the GNU utility the command format is UNIX        
   style with the options before the file names.                                
                                                                                
2. The files must be entered on the command line using "." to separate the      
   components. e.g.                                                             
                                                                                
   profile.exec.a                                                               
                                                                                
3. There are no folders or directories in CMS therefore some of the options are 
   non-functional.                                                              
                                                                                
4. UNIX style ">" to re-direction does not work. To write the output            
   to a file issue a FILEDEF for "SYSTERM" before calling the command           
                                                                                
5. Do "DIFF --help" for details of the options.
