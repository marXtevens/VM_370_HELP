Usage Notes:
 
1.  To compile a C program called HELLO C A, type
       GCC HELLO
    To run the program, you must have the appropriate TXTLIB specified.  Use
    the GLOBAL command to do this:
       GLOBAL TXTLIB PDPCLIB
    Now you can load and run the program:
       LOAD HELLO
       START
    Alternatively you can create a module of your program:
       LOAD HELLO
       GENMOD HELLO
    Now you can invoke the program by typing its name:
       HELLO
 
2.  When opening a file you may simply specify the name e.g.
 
    fptr=fopen("TEST DATA A", "W")
 
    To simplifiy porting the "." character may also be used to separate the
    components of the file, e.g, "TEST.DATA.A" refers to the same file.
 
    PDPCLIB uses OS emulation and needs a FILEDEF. In this case it will
    issue a FILEDEF command "under the covers" with an FD of the form
 
    FILEDEF PDPnnnnn DISK TEST DATA A (RECFM V
 
    to allow access to the file. You may see these DD names
    in error messages.
 
    Should you wish to issue your own FILEDEF commands you may use a
    fie name of the form
 
           DD:<ddname>
 
    and therefore coding an open as follows:-
 
       fopen("DD:TEST", "w");
 
    and issuing the followings FILEDEF command before running the program:
                                                                         :
       FILEDEF TEST DISK TEST DATA A (LRECL 80 RECFM V
 
    would access the same data.
 
3.  The source code for the GCC compiler and runtime libraries is on the
    GCCCMS userid disks.
 
4.  An alternate runtime library called GCCLIB is available for C programs.
    This runtime library lets you code C programs that directly access CMS
    system services.  Type HELP GCCLIB for more information.
